        "current_value": "2s",
        "recommended_value": "5s",
        "priority": "high",
        "justification": "Increasing BatchTimeout allows more transactions to accumulate in a batch before cutoff. At ~4 TPS, a 5s timeout enables ~20 transactions (aligning with MaxMessageCount=20), reducing overhead from frequent small batches. This improves throughput and reduces consensus-related latency.",
        "expected_impact": {
          "performance": "Higher throughput (closer to 20 TPS per batch), reduced average latency for write transactions.",
          "resource_usage": "Slightly higher memory usage per batch but reduced CPU overhead from fewer batches.",
          "risks": [
            "Increased max latency for transactions arriving just after a batch is cut",
            "Underutilized batches if send rate drops below 4 TPS"

        "priority": "medium",
        "justification": "Optimize garbage collection to reduce CPU spikes and pause times. G1GC balances throughput and latency better than default CMS collector for batch processing workloads.",
        "expected_impact": {
          "performance": "Reduced CPU spike magnitude (68% \u2192 ~50%) and GC pause durations",

        "priority": "low",
