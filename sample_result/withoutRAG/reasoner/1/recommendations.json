        "recommended_value": "5s",
        "priority": "high",
        "justification": "Increasing BatchTimeout allows more transactions to accumulate per block, aligning with the current 4 TPS rate (4 TPS * 5s = 20 tx/block). This reduces consensus overhead by creating fuller blocks, improving throughput and latency.",
        "expected_impact": {
          "performance": "Higher throughput (closer to 20 tx/block) and reduced consensus overhead. Latency per transaction may increase slightly (up to 5s wait) but overall system latency should improve due to fewer blocks.",

        "justification": "A single-node Raft configuration violates crash tolerance requirements. Adding 2 more nodes ensures fault tolerance and aligns with etcdraft's design for multi-node clusters.",
