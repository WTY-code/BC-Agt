        "priority": "high",
        "justification": "Current 2s timeout forces low-TPS writes to wait excessively for batch filling. Reducing timeout aligns with observed 4-5 TPS (20 messages would take ~4s to fill at 5 TPS). Smaller timeout reduces artificial latency while maintaining reasonable batch sizes.",
        "expected_impact": {
          "performance": "Latency reduction by 50-75% (target: <0.5s avg for writes)",

        "priority": "high",
        "justification": "Current 20 message threshold is mismatched with low write throughput (4-5 TPS). Reducing to 10 enables faster batch filling (2s at 5 TPS) while working synergistically with 500ms timeout to prioritize latency reduction over batch size optimization.",
