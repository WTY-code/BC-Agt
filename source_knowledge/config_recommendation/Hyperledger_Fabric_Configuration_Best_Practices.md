## Hyperledger Fabric Configuration Best Practices      

1. Block Configuration
   - Optimal block size depends on network capacity and transaction volume
   - For high throughput networks: 100-500 transactions per block
   - For networks with strict latency requirements: 10-50 transactions per block
   - Block timeout: 2s for high performance, 5s for balanced systems            
2. Consensus Configuration
   - Raft ordering service recommended for most deployments
   - Kafka recommended for very high throughput requirements
   - Maximum batch timeout: Should not exceed 2s for optimal performance
3. Endorsement Policies
   - Simple policies (e.g., ANY) for development
   - N of M policies for production (e.g., 2 of 3)
   - Consider organizational requirements and trust model
4. Channel Configuration
   - Separate channels for different business domains
   - Avoid too many channels (increases system overhead)
   - Consider cross-channel queries impact
5. Resource Allocation
   - CPU: Minimum 4 cores per peer
   - Memory: 8GB minimum for peers
   - Disk: SSD recommended, minimum 100GB
   - Network: 1Gbps minimum for production
