## Hyperledger Fabric Scaling Guidelines

1. Horizontal Scaling
   - Add more peers for read scalability
   - Increase orderer nodes for fault tolerance
   - Deploy multiple channels for parallel processing
   - Use private data collections for data partitioning
2. Vertical Scaling
   - Increase CPU cores for transaction processing
   - Add memory for better caching
   - Upgrade to faster storage (NVMe SSDs)
   - Improve network capacity
3. Configuration Scaling
   - Adjust block size based on network capacity
   - Tune batch timeout for optimal throughput
   - Modify endorsement policies for performance
   - Configure cache sizes appropriately
4. Network Optimization
   - Implement service discovery
   - Use gossip protocol effectively
   - Optimize anchor peer selection
   - Configure leader election parameters
5. Monitoring Requirements
   - Track peer resource utilization
   - Monitor orderer performance
   - Analyze transaction latency
   - Measure chaincode execution time
